A list of general ideas related to the project

* Inspired by *A Survey on Region Extractors from Web Documents*. Work on a region extractor for data for different types of 
list records. Extracting structured data from websites based on both dom features and visual features described in the cited works,
but employing a deep-earning/non-heuristical approach to the process.
* Maybe start from the data-region assumption made by many papers before and differentiate between list and detail-view data regions.
Label such regions on different websites and learn to identify structured data in a page.
* Learn different structures of data(table, list, detail)
* *Note* it might be neccessary to describe the formats of data that need to be extracted. Using visual data may be useful for decoding
the structure of the data, but not it's content relevance.
